Auto-Save and Auto-Load Functionality with LocalStorage

This project includes an auto-save feature implemented using the localStorage functionality of the browser. The auto-save feature ensures that the user's code is automatically saved in the browser's local storage as they type. This way, even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page, their code will be preserved.

Additionally, the project includes an auto-load feature that retrieves the previously saved code from localStorage and automatically populates the code editor when the user revisits or refreshes the page. This saves the user from having to manually retrieve and re-enter their code.

By incorporating auto-save and auto-load functionality, this project provides a seamless coding experience.
